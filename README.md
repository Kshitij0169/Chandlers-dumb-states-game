## Introduction

In _Friends_, Chandler attempts to name all 50 U.S. states, and hilariously struggles to do so. This Python project brings that challenge to life, where players will be prompted to enter U.S. states in a Turtle graphics window, and correct answers are displayed on a blank U.S. map.

## Features

- 🖼️ Interactive game using **Turtle Graphics** with a U.S. map.
- 📜 Data handling and state verification using **Pandas**.
- 💾 Save unguessed states to `MissingStates.csv` if you give up!
- 🎮 Real-time tracking of correct guesses and progress.

## Requirements

To run the project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install turtle pandas
```
